## SECTION 1 — Economy

---

### Claim E1: "Our nation is back, bigger, better, richer and stronger than ever before."

**Rating:** Mixture

**Evidence:**
- U.S. GDP growth: 2.2% in 2025, down from 2.8% in 2024 (Biden's final year). GDP shrank in Q1 2025 for the first time in three years. ([AP](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-trump-state-of-union-87b184f7a38e65fa97d27c05ba2497fa))
- Hiring: Employers added only 181,000 jobs in 2025 — the fewest outside a recession since 2002. ([AP](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-trump-state-of-union-87b184f7a38e65fa97d27c05ba2497fa))
- Stock market: S&P 500 gained 17% in 2025, but was outperformed by South Korea (+71%), Hong Kong (+29%), Japan (+26%), Germany (+22%), UK (+21%). ([AP](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-trump-state-of-union-87b184f7a38e65fa97d27c05ba2497fa))
- Trump's overall disapproval rating hit 60% in an ABC/WaPo/Ipsos poll released Feb. 22. Six in 10 Americans say the country is worse off than a year ago. ([ABC News](https://abcnews.com/Politics/fact-checking-trumps-state-union-address/story?id=130459365))

**Analysis:** Some economic indicators are positive (inflation down, crime down, Olympic gold). But U.S. economic growth was actually faster under Biden in 2024. Job growth is near-recessionary levels, the stock market underperformed peers, and a majority of Americans disagree with the assessment. "Stronger than ever before" is demonstrably false by most metrics.

### Claim E2: "In 12 months, my administration has driven core inflation to the lowest level in more than five years."

**Rating:** Mostly True

**Evidence:**
- Core CPI (excluding food and energy) was 2.5% YoY in January 2026, the lowest since April 2021 — approximately 5 years. ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/24/trump-state-of-the-union-live-updates.html))
- Headline CPI was 2.4% in January 2026, down from 2.7% in December 2025. ([BLS via ABC News](https://abcnews.com/Politics/fact-checking-trumps-state-union-address/story?id=130459365))
- However, inflation was already 3% when Trump took office and had fallen from a 9% peak in summer 2022, a decline driven largely by Fed policy. "Plummeting" overstates the recent trajectory. ([KCRA/AP](https://www.kcra.com/article/fact-check-trump-state-of-union/70485471))
- Tariffs have pushed prices up on specific goods: ground coffee +34%, fresh produce and beef also up. Energy costs rose 6.3% from Jan 2025 to Jan 2026. ([ABC News](https://abcnews.com/Politics/fact-checking-trumps-state-union-address/story?id=130459365))

**Analysis:** The core inflation figure is technically accurate. But the word "plummeting" is an overstatement — the trend was already downward before Trump, and the Federal Reserve deserves significant credit. Tariff-driven price increases in several consumer categories undercut the broader affordability message.

---

### Claim E3: "Egg prices fell by 60%."

**Rating:** Mostly False

**Evidence:**
- Consumer Price Index data from the BLS report published February 13, 2026, shows egg prices down approximately **34.2%** year-over-year. ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/13/egg-prices-falling-in-us.html))
- In January 2025, some retailers were charging over $9 for a dozen eggs during the avian flu outbreak. ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/14/why-eggs-are-so-expensive-when-prices-will-drop.html))
- The 34.2% decline is significant but the actual figure is roughly 40% lower than Trump's stated 60%.

**Analysis:** Egg prices did fall substantially, primarily because the avian flu crisis that caused the spike has eased — not directly as a result of administration policy. The 60% figure overstates the decline by roughly 25 percentage points according to official government data.

---

### Claim E4: "As time goes by, I believe the tariffs, paid for by foreign countries, will substantially replace the modern-day system of income tax."

**Rating:** False

**Evidence:**
- Tariffs are legally paid by **U.S. importers**, not foreign countries — a basic economic fact repeated by virtually all economists. The burden then gets passed on to consumers through higher prices. ([CNN live blog](https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-state-of-the-union-2026))
- The Supreme Court struck down the bulk of Trump's tariff authority (IEEPA-based) in a ruling just days before the SOTU. ([ABC News](https://abcnews.com/Politics/trump-continues-lash-supreme-court-after-tariff-ruling/story?id=130407379))
- The federal government collects approximately $30 billion/month in tariffs. Individual and corporate income taxes generate roughly $260 billion/month. Tariffs replacing income tax would require a ~9x increase. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2026/02/24/nx-s1-5716277/trump-state-union-fact-check))
- Manufacturing shed 108,000 jobs in 2025, the opposite of the renaissance Trump attributes to tariffs. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2026/02/24/nx-s1-5716277/trump-state-union-fact-check))

**Analysis:** Two claims embedded here are both false: (1) tariffs are not "paid by foreign countries" — they are paid by American importers and consumers; (2) the math for replacing income tax with tariffs doesn't work at current volumes, and the Supreme Court had just curtailed his tariff authority.

---

### Claim E5: "In 12 months, I secured commitments for more than $18 trillion pouring in from all over the globe."

**Rating:** Mostly False

**Evidence:**
- The White House's own investment website lists **$9.6 trillion** in domestic and foreign investments. ([whitehouse.gov/investments](https://www.whitehouse.gov/investments/) via [ABC News](https://abcnews.com/Politics/fact-checking-trumps-state-union-address/story?id=130459365))
- The $9.6T figure itself appears inflated — e.g., Qatar is listed as a $1.2T "investment" but the actual White House fact sheet describes it as an "economic exchange," not an investment commitment. ([ABC News](https://abcnews.com/Politics/fact-checking-trumps-state-union-address/story?id=130459365))
- CATO Institute and Bloomberg analyses both found the $18T figure substantially inflated. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2026/02/24/nx-s1-5716277/trump-state-union-fact-check))
- A January 2026 study raised doubts about whether more than $5 trillion in commitments from trading partners will materialize. ([AP](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-trump-state-of-union-87b184f7a38e65fa97d27c05ba2497fa))

**Analysis:** Trump's own administration's website shows $9.6 trillion, less than half the $18T claimed. That figure is also inflated by including commitments made under the Biden administration and non-investment "economic exchanges." The $18T number appears to have no documentary basis.

---

### Claim E6: "American oil production is up by more than 600,000 barrels a day... drill, baby, drill."

**Rating:** Mostly False

**Evidence:**
- The U.S. Energy Information Administration reports U.S. crude oil production rose approximately **400,000 barrels per day** in 2025 — not 600,000. ([EIA via NPR](https://www.npr.org/2026/02/24/nx-s1-5716277/trump-state-union-fact-check))
- U.S. oil output rose for **four consecutive years** before Trump's second term, continuing an existing trend not initiated by the administration. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2026/02/24/nx-s1-5716277/trump-state-union-fact-check))
- The number of active drilling rigs is actually **down 7%** from a year ago, per Baker Hughes — the opposite of a drilling boom. Companies are being cautious due to low oil prices. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2026/02/24/nx-s1-5716277/trump-state-union-fact-check))
- EIA forecasts production will **drop by ~100,000 barrels/day in 2026**. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2026/02/24/nx-s1-5716277/trump-state-union-fact-check))

**Analysis:** The production increase figure is overstated by roughly 50%, and the upward trend predates Trump. Far from a "drill, baby, drill" boom, active rig counts are down and production is expected to fall in 2026.

---

### Claim E7: "Every service member recently received a warrior dividend of $1,776."

**Rating:** Mixture

**Evidence:**
- Trump announced the $1,776 "warrior dividend" in December 2025. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2026/02/24/nx-s1-5716277/trump-state-union-fact-check))
- The funds came from the "One Big Beautiful Bill" omnibus budget bill — **Congress** appropriated $2.9 billion for military housing subsidies. Trump rebranded these Congressional housing funds as the "warrior dividend." ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2026/02/24/nx-s1-5716277/trump-state-union-fact-check))
- Trump also said the money "came from tariffs," which is misleading — budget appropriations are not tied to tariff revenue in this way.

**Analysis:** Service members did receive $1,776. However, the framing is misleading: Trump is claiming credit for a Congressional appropriation and mischaracterizing its funding source as "tariffs."

---

## SECTION 2 — Immigration

---

### Claim I1: "As we speak, Democrats in this chamber have cut off all funding for the Department of Homeland Security."

**Rating:** Mostly True

**Evidence:**
- Democrats did block DHS funding over concerns about ICE overreach, triggering a partial DHS shutdown. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2026/02/24/nx-s1-5716277/trump-state-union-fact-check))
- Trump's own administration had previously diminished DHS's counterterrorism capacity: veteran counterterrorism officials departed, budget cuts eliminated community-based prevention programs, and a 22-year-old with no law enforcement experience was placed in charge of one prevention program. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2026/02/24/nx-s1-5716277/trump-state-union-fact-check))

**Analysis:** Democrats did withhold DHS appropriations, which is factually true. But Trump's framing of Democrats as solely responsible for the agency's problems omits that his own administration had already significantly reduced DHS's operational capacity through budget cuts, personnel departures, and unconventional appointments.

---

### Claim I2: Immigrants poured in "from prisons, from mental institutions" — "11,888 murders."

**Rating:** False

**Evidence:**
- There is no evidence that immigrants were systematically released from foreign prisons or mental institutions under the Biden administration. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2026/02/24/nx-s1-5716277/trump-state-union-fact-check))
- Programs like parole and CBP One required entry screenings and interviews. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2026/02/24/nx-s1-5716277/trump-state-union-fact-check))
- Extensive research, including from the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, shows immigrants — documented and undocumented — are **less likely** to be arrested for violent, drug, and property crimes than native-born Americans. ([PNAS, AP](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-trump-state-of-union-87b184f7a38e65fa97d27c05ba2497fa))
- As of Feb. 7, 2026, 74% of people in ICE detention had **no criminal conviction**. ([ABC News/ICE data](https://abcnews.com/Politics/fact-checking-trumps-state-union-address/story?id=130459365))

**Analysis:** The "prisons and mental institutions" claim is a long-running Trump trope with no supporting evidence. Research consistently shows undocumented immigrants are less crime-prone than the native-born population.

---

### Claim I3: "Zero illegal aliens have been admitted in the past nine months."

**Rating:** False

**Evidence:**
- In 2025, the number of illegal border crossings dropped dramatically to approximately **28,000 encounters** for the full year, down from 1.5 million in 2024. ([ABC News/CBP data](https://abcnews.com/Politics/fact-checking-trumps-state-union-address/story?id=130459365))
- CBP data confirm the number has never been at zero. Migrants are still attempting to cross. ([ABC News](https://abcnews.com/Politics/fact-checking-trumps-state-union-address/story?id=130459365))

**Analysis:** Illegal crossings have fallen dramatically — a legitimate administration accomplishment — but "zero" is factually incorrect and impossible to verify even if nearly true, given undetected crossings.

---

### Claim I4: "More than 300,000 migrant children are missing."

**Rating:** False

**Evidence:**
- This figure misrepresents a DHS Office of Inspector General report from August 2024, which found that ICE failed to consistently **monitor the location and status** of unaccompanied migrant children after they were released from federal custody. ([AP](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-misinformation-migrant-children-missing-7ab0cea2fd2238346197429e952baa8b))
- The report did not say children are "missing" — it said their whereabouts were not being tracked after release. These are substantially different claims.

**Analysis:** A monitoring failure is serious, but it is not the same as 300,000 children being missing. Trump has repeatedly used this misrepresentation to inflate immigration threat claims.

---

### Claim I5: Iryna Zarutska was killed by a criminal "set free to kill in America — came in through open borders."

**Rating:** False

**Evidence:**
- Iryna Zarutska was fatally stabbed on August 22, 2025 in Charlotte, N.C., by 34-year-old DeCarlos Brown Jr. ([NPR/Charlotte Observer](https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/crime/article312024785.html))
- Local media reporting confirms DeCarlos Brown Jr. was **born and raised in Charlotte, N.C.** and had spent time in and out of North Carolina jails. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2026/02/24/nx-s1-5716277/trump-state-union-fact-check))
- There is no evidence Brown was an immigrant or came through the southern border.

**Analysis:** This is a flat fabrication in service of a political narrative. The documented facts directly contradict Trump's characterization of the killer as an immigrant who entered through "open borders."

---

### Claim I6: Members of the Somali community "pillaged an estimated $19 billion from the American taxpayer" in Minnesota.

**Rating:** Mostly False

**Evidence:**
- The DOJ has charged approximately 100 defendants — many of Somali descent — in connection with fraud connected to federal programs in Minnesota. ([White House, NPR](https://www.npr.org/2026/02/24/nx-s1-5716277/trump-state-union-fact-check))
- The most high-profile case, Feeding Our Future, involved fraud of approximately **$250 million** from COVID-era child nutrition programs. ([DOJ, NPR](https://www.npr.org/2026/02/24/nx-s1-5716277/trump-state-union-fact-check))
- The $19 billion figure is approximately **76 times** larger than the documented Feeding Our Future fraud. No source has been provided for this figure.

**Analysis:** Real fraud did occur and prosecutions are underway. However, $19 billion is unsupported by any prosecution data and is wildly inflated. Trump is also using individual criminal cases to smear the broader Somali-American community, having previously called Somali immigrants "garbage who contribute nothing."

---

## SECTION 3 — Foreign Policy

---

### Claim F1: "In my first 10 months, I ended eight wars." (Israel-Hamas, Israel-Iran, Egypt-Ethiopia, India-Pakistan, Serbia-Kosovo, Rwanda-Congo, Armenia-Azerbaijan, Cambodia-Thailand)

**Rating:** Mostly False

**Evidence:**
- Israel-Hamas: A ceasefire was brokered last October. However, Israel has continued airstrikes in Gaza, killing hundreds of Palestinians since the truce, and both sides have alleged multiple violations. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2026/01/31/g-s1-108142/israeli-strikes-kill-23-palestinians-gaza))
- Israel-Iran: The U.S. and Israel exchanged strikes with Iran for 12 days in June 2025 before a truce. No underlying issues were resolved; Trump is already threatening Iran again as of SOTU night. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2026/02/24/nx-s1-5716277/trump-state-union-fact-check), [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/24/trump-state-union-key-issues))
- Multiple conflicts on his list (e.g., Rwanda-Congo, Armenia-Azerbaijan) were either already resolved before Trump took office or saw U.S. diplomatic involvement without clear resolution. ([AP pre-SOTU](https://apnews.com/article/trump-wars-fact-focus-a75eca5184bd45acbf9f46ff9822514f))
- The Guardian notes Trump has "inaccurately claimed to have ended seven or eight wars." ([Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/24/trump-state-union-key-issues))

**Analysis:** Trump brokered real ceasefires in a few conflicts, most notably Gaza — a legitimate accomplishment. But "ended" is too strong for fragile ceasefires still under active violation, and several listed conflicts were minimally influenced by U.S. action or predated his involvement.

---

### Claim F2: "We just received from our new friend and partner, Venezuela, more than 80 million barrels of oil."

**Rating:** Mixture

**Evidence:**
- The U.S. captured Nicolás Maduro in a military operation in January 2026 and has been facilitating Venezuelan oil sales through Swiss trading firms Vitol and Trafigura (both previously convicted of DOJ bribery charges during the Biden administration). ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2026/02/24/nx-s1-5716277/trump-state-union-fact-check))
- Secretary of Energy Chris Wright says U.S.-facilitated oil sales total more than **$1 billion**. However, Venezuela has acknowledged receiving only **$300 million**; a further $200 million is reportedly in a Qatari bank account. The destination of the remaining funds is unclear. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2026/02/24/nx-s1-5716277/trump-state-union-fact-check))
- The U.S. is already the world's largest oil producer and the global market is currently oversupplied. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2026/02/24/nx-s1-5716277/trump-state-union-fact-check))

**Analysis:** Oil is being received, but "friend and partner" mischaracterizes the situation — the U.S. captured Maduro and seized his oil revenues. The revenue accounting is murky; Venezuela's government says it is receiving less than a third of what's been collected.

---

### Claim F3: Iran's nuclear program was "obliterated" in Operation Midnight Hammer.

**Rating:** Mostly False

**Evidence:**
- U.S. and Israeli strikes in June 2025 inflicted **major damage** on Iran's nuclear program. ([ABC News](https://abcnews.com/Politics/trump-weighs-strikes-iran-nuclear-program-obliterated/story?id=130426644))
- IAEA Director Rafael Grossi stated that much of Iran's stockpile of highly enriched uranium "likely remains" at the strike sites — some may be less accessible but the material is still there. The IAEA estimates **972 pounds of highly enriched uranium** remain unaccounted for. ([ABC News](https://abcnews.com/Politics/fact-checking-trumps-state-union-address/story?id=130459365))
- Satellite imagery shows Iran **rebuilding** its nuclear facilities. ([ABC News](https://abcnews.com/Politics/fact-checking-trumps-state-union-address/story?id=130459365))
- The claim is internally contradictory: Trump is simultaneously saying it was "obliterated" and threatening new strikes because Iran wants to "start all over again." ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2026/02/24/nx-s1-5716277/trump-state-union-fact-check))

**Analysis:** The strikes caused significant damage, but "obliterated" is demonstrably false — the program was setback, not destroyed. Iran's enriched uranium stockpile remains, and Iran is rebuilding. Trump cannot simultaneously claim total destruction and justify new attacks.

---

### Claim F4: Iranian security forces "killed at least 32,000 protesters — 32,000 protesters in their own country."

**Rating:** False

**Evidence:**
- The Human Rights Activist News Agency (HRANA) has put the death toll in Iran's crackdown at **more than 7,000**. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2026/02/22/nx-s1-5718397/iranians-mark-a-day-of-mourning-as-the-u-s-ramps-up-uts-military-presence))
- Iran's own government acknowledged **more than 3,000 deaths**, including both protesters and security forces.
- Trump's 32,000 figure is approximately **4.5 times** higher than the highest credible human rights estimate.

**Analysis:** Iran's crackdown on protesters was brutal and real. But Trump's death toll of 32,000 is unsupported by any credible source and appears fabricated or wildly exaggerated.

---

## SECTION 4 — Health Care

---

### Claim D1: "I took prescription drugs from the highest price in the entire world to the lowest."

**Rating:** False

**Evidence:**
- Americans still pay **several times more** for prescription drugs than peer nations. ([Yale School of Public Health study, ABC News](https://abcnews.com/Politics/fact-checking-trumps-state-union-address/story?id=130459365))
- Trump's biggest initiative, TrumpRx, offers about 40 drugs at discount for uninsured cash-pay customers. For most insured Americans, the site is more expensive than using their insurance copay. ([KFF analysis, NPR](https://www.npr.org/2026/02/24/nx-s1-5716277/trump-state-union-fact-check))
- Several major recent price cuts — including Bristol Myers Squibb's Eliquis (50% cut) and Eli Lilly's Jardiance (66% cut) — resulted from **Biden-era** Medicare price negotiation legislation, not Trump policy. ([ABC News](https://abcnews.com/Politics/fact-checking-trumps-state-union-address/story?id=130459365))
- ACA premiums **doubled on average** this year after Republicans declined to extend enhanced tax credits. More than one million people dropped coverage. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2026/02/24/nx-s1-5716277/trump-state-union-fact-check))

**Analysis:** Some targeted drug price reductions have occurred for specific cash-pay patients. But the claim that the U.S. went from "highest to lowest" prices is demonstrably false — the U.S. still has among the highest prescription drug costs in the world, and the most significant recent price cuts stem from Biden-era legislation.

---

### Claim D2: "I want to stop all payments to big insurance companies and instead give that money directly to the people."

**Rating:** Mostly False

**Evidence:**
- Trump's "Great Health Care Plan" is not actual legislation — it is a White House video and one-page fact sheet with no specific funding mechanisms, distribution method, or dollar amounts. ([ABC News](https://abcnews.com/Politics/fact-checking-trumps-state-union-address/story?id=130459365), [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2026/02/24/nx-s1-5716277/trump-state-union-fact-check))
- The plan promotes health savings accounts (HSAs) and skinny plans — which are still private insurance products. All HSA-compatible plans pay premiums to insurance companies. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2026/02/24/nx-s1-5716277/trump-state-union-fact-check))
- The administration's "Great Healthcare Plan" actually appears to reinstate cost-sharing reduction payments to insurers — the opposite of "stopping payments to insurance companies." ([ABC News](https://abcnews.com/Politics/fact-checking-trumps-state-union-address/story?id=130459365))
- Congress debated a health care package earlier in 2026 but failed to reach consensus.

**Analysis:** The description of the plan is internally contradictory — Trump proposes to eliminate payments to insurers while simultaneously promoting insurance-based products that fund insurers. The "Great Health Care Plan" has no legislative text and no implementation mechanism.

---

## SECTION 5 — Domestic Policy

---

### Claim D3: "Last year, the murder rate saw its single largest decline in recorded history — the lowest number in over 125 years."

**Rating:** Mixture

**Evidence:**
- The homicide rate in 35 studied cities dropped **21%** in 2025 vs. 2024, per the Council on Criminal Justice. If the trend holds nationally, the FBI murder rate could be approximately 4 per 100,000 — potentially the lowest since 1900. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2026/02/24/nx-s1-5716277/trump-state-union-fact-check))
- However, violent crime was **already declining under Biden**. In Biden's final year (2024), violent crime dropped to a 20-year low nationally. ([Axios, FBI data](https://www.axios.com/2025/08/06/violent-crime-rate-fell-lowest-fbi))
- In Washington D.C. specifically: homicides fell 32% in 2025, but D.C. crime was already at a 30-year low at end of 2024 per the DOJ. ([ABC News/MPD/DOJ](https://abcnews.com/Politics/fact-checking-trumps-state-union-address/story?id=130459365))
- Trump also claimed D.C. January murders were "down close to 100%." D.C. police recorded 2 homicides in January 2026 — very low, but not zero. ([ABC News/MPD](https://abcnews.com/Politics/fact-checking-trumps-state-union-address/story?id=130459365))

**Analysis:** The homicide decline in 2025 is real and numerically may be historic. However, Trump is claiming credit for a trend that predates his second term. Crime was already declining sharply under Biden. The "125 years" claim may be directionally accurate once full national data arrives, but the political attribution is misleading.

---

### Claim D4: "There has been a tremendous renewal in religion, faith and Christianity and belief in God."

**Rating:** Mostly False

**Evidence:**
- Pew Research Center published data in December 2025 finding **no evidence** of a religious revival among young people. ([Pew Research Center, CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/24/trump-state-of-the-union-live-updates.html))
- After decades of decline, the Christian share of the population **leveled off** and remained relatively stable since approximately 2020 — but it is not growing. ([Pew Research Center, Feb 2025](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2025/02/26/decline-of-christianity-in-the-us-has-slowed-may-have-leveled-off/))
- The percentage of religiously unaffiliated Americans remains at historic highs.

**Analysis:** The decline in Christian affiliation has stabilized — that's it. A leveling off after decades of decline is not a "tremendous renewal." Pew found no evidence of any revival.

---

### Claim D5: "The cheating is rampant in our elections. It's rampant."

**Rating:** False

**Evidence:**
- Noncitizen voting in federal elections has never been found to occur in more than microscopic numbers. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2026/02/24/nx-s1-5716277/trump-state-union-fact-check))
- State audits: Michigan found **16 alleged noncitizen votes** out of 5.7 million cast; Iowa found **35** out of 1.67 million; Georgia found **9** out of 8.2 million registered voters who actually cast ballots. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2026/02/24/nx-s1-5716277/trump-state-union-fact-check), [ABC News](https://abcnews.com/Politics/fact-checking-trumps-state-union-address/story?id=130459365))
- The Center for Election Innovation & Research: most voter fraud allegations arise from "misunderstandings, mischaracterizations, or outright fabrications." ([ABC News](https://abcnews.com/Politics/fact-checking-trumps-state-union-address/story?id=130459365))
- Federal law already requires identity verification at voter registration.

**Analysis:** By any measurable standard, voter fraud in American federal elections is extraordinarily rare — not "rampant." Comprehensive audits in competitive states found single-digit to double-digit cases out of millions of votes. The claim is false.

### Claim D6: Data centers / AI energy — "I have negotiated the new ratepayer protection pledge... electricity prices will go down very substantially."

**Rating:** Mostly False

**Evidence:**
- Electricity prices rose **6.3%** in the 12 months leading up to January 2026 — more than double the general inflation rate. Part of this is driven by the increased energy demand from AI data centers. ([ABC News/BLS](https://abcnews.com/Politics/fact-checking-trumps-state-union-address/story?id=130459365), [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2026/02/24/nx-s1-5716277/trump-state-union-fact-check))
- The "ratepayer protection pledge" is a voluntary agreement Trump says he negotiated with major tech companies to build their own power plants — not a binding law or regulation.
- The claim that electricity prices will go "very substantially down" contradicts current BLS data showing a 6.3% recent increase.

**Analysis:** Electricity prices are up, not down. The voluntary pledge is an aspiration, not an enforceable commitment. Trump is making a forward-looking promise that the current data directly contradicts.

## SECTION 6 — Elections

---

### Claim EL1: (Implied throughout the speech context) Trump won the 2020 presidential election.

**Rating:** False

**Evidence:**
- Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election with **306 electoral votes** to Trump's 232, and by more than **7 million popular votes**. ([FEC](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf))
- Biden's win was affirmed through recounts, audits, and reviews in all contested battleground states. ([AP](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-trump-state-of-union-87b184f7a38e65fa97d27c05ba2497fa))
- Trump's allies lost **dozens of court challenges**. His own Attorney General, William Barr, stated there was no widespread fraud that would have altered the results. ([AP](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-trump-state-of-union-87b184f7a38e65fa97d27c05ba2497fa))

**Analysis:** This is an established falsehood. It has been rejected by courts, election officials of both parties, Trump's own Department of Justice, and independent audits in every contested state.

---

### Claim EL2: Trump's 2024 win was a "landslide."

**Rating:** Mostly False

**Evidence:**
- Trump won 312 electoral votes to Harris's 226, including all 7 swing states. ([FEC](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/2024presgeresults.pdf))
- Popular vote: Trump received **49.8%** (77.3M votes) vs. Harris's **48.3%** (75.0M votes) — a margin of approximately 1.5 percentage points. ([AP](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-trump-state-of-union-87b184f7a38e65fa97d27c05ba2497fa))
- By comparison, Reagan's 1984 landslide: 525 electoral votes, 18.2% popular vote margin. Obama 2008: 365 electoral votes, 7.2% margin. Trump's 2024 victory does not compare favorably to historical landslides.

**Analysis:** Trump won the 2024 election, including all swing states — that's legitimate. But the popular vote margin was razor-thin at approximately 1.5 points. "Landslide" typically implies a commanding margin; this does not qualify.
